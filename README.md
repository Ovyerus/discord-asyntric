# Asyntric
A W.I.P theme for [Discord](https://discordapp.com).

Use an asar patcher like [BeautifulDiscord](https://github.com/leovoel/BeautifulDiscord) to use this.

asyntric.css is the one you'll want to use, asyntric.styl is for development.

If you don't want to keep manually updating the theme, choose autotheme.css

NOTE: This theme is developed using Discord Canary, so if you use this theme on versions such as Stable or PTB, some things may not look right, or may not be styled.
